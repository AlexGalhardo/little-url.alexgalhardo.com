### Multi-Tenant Approaches

1. **Shared Database with Tenant Filtering (Single Database, Shared Schema)**
	- **How ​​it works:** All tenants share the same database and table structure. Each record is associated with a specific tenant through a `tenant_id` column or similar.
	- **Advantages:**
	- Simpler to implement and maintain.
	- Lower infrastructure costs, since all tenants share the same resources.
	- **Disadvantages:**
	- Can be more difficult to scale at large scale. - Risk of data leakage between tenants if filtering by `tenant_id` is not implemented correctly.
	- **Key technical points:**
	- Ensure that all database queries include filtering by `tenant_id`.
	- Implement caching strategies that respect tenant segmentation.
	- Ensure that adequate indexes exist for the `tenant_id` column to maintain performance.

2. **Shared Database with Separate Schemas (Single Database, Separate Schema)**
	- **How ​​it works:** All tenants share the same database, but each has its own schema, with its own tables.
	- **Advantages:**
	- Improves isolation between tenants compared to the filtered model.
	- Easier to manage backups and restores per tenant.
	- **Disadvantages:**
	- Increases the complexity of database management.
	- May be more difficult to scale if the number of schemas is very large. - **Key technical points:**
	- Automate the creation and management of schemas for new tenants.
	- Implement migration strategies that can be applied to all schemas.
	- Configure specific monitoring for each schema.

3. **Separate Databases (Separate Database per Tenant)**
	- **How ​​it works:** Each tenant has its own separate database.
	- **Advantages:**
	- Maximum data isolation and security.
	- Easier horizontal scalability.
	- **Disadvantages:**
	- Higher operational cost, due to the larger number of databases.
	- More difficult to manage and orchestrate changes to the database structure.
	- **Key technical points:**
	- Implement mechanisms for dynamic connection routing based on the tenant.
	- Automate the provisioning and maintenance of databases.
	- Keep database migration scripts synchronized between all tenants.

4. **Full Isolation (Separate Deployments by Tenant)**
	- **How ​​it works:** Each tenant has its own application instance and database, completely isolated.
	- **Advantages:**
	- Complete isolation, both in terms of data and performance.
	- Flexibility for specific customizations for each tenant.
	- **Disadvantages:**
	- Extremely high cost in terms of infrastructure.
	- High operational complexity.
	- **Main technical points:**
	- Implement CI/CD pipelines that can manage multiple deployments.
	- Configure individual monitoring and alerts for each tenant.
	- Manage infrastructure on demand (e.g., using containers or VMs) to scale and descale environments as needed.

### Other Important Technical Points

- **Authentication and Authorization:**
	- Implement a robust authentication system to ensure that each user only has access to the data of their tenant.
	- Authorization should be done on two levels: first, ensure that the user has access to the correct tenant, and then verify permissions within that tenant.

- **Monitoring and Logging:**
	- Configure logs that include `tenant_id` to facilitate auditing and issue tracking.
	- Monitor resource usage by tenant to identify tenants that may be using more resources than expected.

- **Billing and Collections:**
	- If necessary, implement a billing system based on resource usage by tenant.
	- Monitor and report infrastructure costs and associate them with tenants.

- **Database Migrations:**
	- Depending on the approach chosen, database migrations can become more complex.
	- Consider tools that support multi-tenant migrations or develop scripts that can be applied to all schemas or databases.

- **Security:**
	- Isolate data as much as possible and ensure that the application does not allow cross-tenant access.
